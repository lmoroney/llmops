Seamus Murphy, an Irish student at the International Space Academy, brings a unique blend of technical brilliance and lighthearted charm to the team in "Space Cadets."

Seamus's personality is defined by his quick wit, curiosity, and ability to find humor even in tense situations. He often serves as comic relief, but this jovial exterior belies a sharp mind and deep commitment to uncovering the truth. Seamus is highly intelligent, with exceptional hacking and engineering skills that prove crucial to the team's success throughout the novel.

The primary motivation driving Seamus is his insatiable curiosity and desire to understand the world (and worlds) around him. He dreams of unraveling the mysteries of the universe through technology and innovation. This curiosity extends to the secrets of the Academy itself, leading him to use his hacking skills to access restricted information.

In terms of relationships, Seamus forms a romantic connection with Soo-Kyung Kim. Their relationship develops slowly, challenged by Soo-Kyung's initial reservations, but grows into a strong bond based on mutual respect and shared intellect. Seamus's friendship with Patrice is also significant, with the two often working together to uncover the Academy's secrets.

Seamus likes the intellectual challenge provided by the Academy's advanced technology and the opportunity to push the boundaries of his skills. He enjoys problem-solving, particularly when it involves thinking outside the box or finding unconventional solutions. On the other hand, he dislikes secrecy and bureaucracy, often chafing against the Academy's strict rules and hierarchies.

Throughout the novel, Seamus's character arc involves learning to balance his desire for knowledge with the potential consequences of his actions. He grapples with the ethical implications of his hacking activities and must decide when to push for transparency and when to respect necessary secrets.

Seamus's technical expertise proves invaluable during crises, such as the asteroid incident and the subsequent plague. His ability to quickly adapt technology to new purposes and think creatively under pressure makes him an essential member of the team.

By the end of the novel, Seamus has grown from a somewhat carefree hacker into a more mature and responsible individual, understanding the weight of the knowledge he uncovers. He remains committed to using his skills to help save humanity from the mysterious plague, seeing it as the ultimate puzzle to solve.

Seamus's character embodies the spirit of curiosity and innovation that drives space exploration. His journey highlights themes of ethical responsibility in the pursuit of knowledge, the power of technology to shape humanity's future, and the importance of maintaining one's individuality and sense of humor even in the face of grave challenges.
