    "message": "That's an interesting and rather unique topic! To help me further understand the scope, let's delve a little deeper. \n\n1. Is the focus more on the biological aspects of wombats' migration patterns or are we looking at the impact of climate change, urbanization, or other external factors?\n\n2. Are there specific phases of wombats' migration that we should highlight? \n\n3. Do you want to explore any difference in migration patterns within various types of wombats? \n\n4. Do we want to tie this into a larger conservation or environmental message? \n\n5. What is the intended audience for this speech â€“ general public, students, scientists, environmentalists?\n   \nBased on your answers, we can structure the talk in a way that starts with an attention grabbing introduction, segues into easy-to-understand science, presents fascinating wombats' migration facts, discusses impacts, and ends with a strong, engaging conclusion.",
